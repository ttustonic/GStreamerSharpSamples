# GStreamerSharpSamples
Tutorials and samples for GStreamerSharp

C# tutorials translated to C# from https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/tutorials/. These versions are different than the official samples (https://github.com/GStreamer/gstreamer-sharp/tree/master/samples).

Additionally, there are a few demos of using web cameras with GStreamer Sharp and WinForms and WPF versions of Basic tutorial 5 and VideoOverlay samples (https://github.com/GStreamer/gstreamer-sharp/blob/master/samples/VideoOverlay.cs).

These samples use custom build gstreamer-sharp dlls and gtk dependencies. These are built using gvsbuild project (https://github.com/wingtk/gvsbuild)
